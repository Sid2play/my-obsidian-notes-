Week 2: 

Chapter 1 notes; 

1.1
Economic problem :
	- Our wants are unlimited 
	- Resources are scarce, limiting the resources needed for our wants 
	As all our wants can not be satisfied, we have to choose between them 
	Which results in ranking our preferences - we choose our highest preference wants, leaving others unsatisfied
	1)  Due to limited resources, an economy must determine which goods and services will be produced to satisfy the most pressing wants. 
	2) To prevent waste and ensure the best use of resources, an economy must carefully decide how much of each good or service to produce. 
	3) The production process should be as efficient as possible to maximize output while using the least amount of resources. 
	4) An economy must determine how to distribute goods and services, balancing fairness and efficiency based on income levels.


1.2
The production possibility frontier :
	Opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that is forgone when a choice is made. It represents the benefits or opportunities lost when scarce resources are allocated to one option instead of another.

	New technology can make production more efficient, allowing more goods to be produced with the same resources. This causes an outward shift in the production possibility frontier, as seen in improved oil extraction methods increasing maximum oil production.	
|
	Anything which has an effect on the production possibility frontier. As a result of these new inputs, it would cause the production of both good increase. (The oil and leather picture) ![Pasted image 20250204193436.png](/img/user/Pasted%20image%2020250204193436.png) 


1.3
The Future implications of choices :
	In reality, resources are not perfectly adaptable between different types of production. Some resources are better suited for producing oil, while others are better for leather. As more resources shift to leather production, they become less efficient, increasing the opportunity cost. This results in a concave production possibility frontier rather than a straight line.

	Economic choices made today affect future outcomes. An economy can choose to produce consumer goods for immediate satisfaction or capital goods, like machinery, to expand future production capacity. While capital goods do not meet present consumer demands, they enable greater production in the long run, leading to higher economic growth. Prioritising capital goods now means sacrificing some current wants to better satisfy future needs.
|
	Choosing capital goods over consumer goods sacrifices present wants for future economic growth and increased production capacity.

1.4 
The economic factors underlying choices : 
1) Economic decision overview; 
		Economic choices are influenced by short and long term goals. 
		Individuals, businesses, and governments each weigh different factors when making economic decisions 
|
	Individuals:
		factors which may affect their decision making:
			Age, income, future plans, family, personality (such as a risk taking vs savings )
		income levels determine whether individuals can save or focus on spending for necessities. 
			Those in extreme poverty spend 2/3s of their income on good - (World bank, 2022)
		Economic policies are influenced by individuals by voting:
			issues like tax policies, unemployment, inflation, interest rates shape the way voters vote. 
|
	Businesses:
		Pricing Decisions: 
			Higher prices may maximise profits but affect sales
		Production & costs:
			Businesses aim to minimise costs while maintaining quality 
			In doing so, there are some ethical concerns:
				avoiding modern slavery, using sustainable resources, etc 

| 
	Government: 
		The influence on individuals & business:
			Taxes & subsidies affect decision-making
		regulations: price ceilings and price floors 
		incentives: 
			Example: tax rebates for private health insurance increased coverage from 30% to 55% of the population 
		Direct involvement: 
			Governments also provide essential goods and services
